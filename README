The goal of the package is to enable a sort of "first aid"-kit, 
that starts when something during the installation or startup did 
not work like expected.

Start time: 

   - at the beginning of the bootup
   - it forks a script into background 
   - and continues the startup.

   - The background script's first step is waiting for 15 minutes.
   - Based upon a configuration, it checks if some
   - processes and mount-points are availalbe.
   - If not, it starts the default dnsmasq & uhttpd service 
     (if not running)


Inside the /www /www/cgi-bin  an additional script file, that

   - Gives a simple information page
   - runs the commands from the troubleshooting page,
     which provides the user a quick overview of the system
     and helps for the first analysis.
